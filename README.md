# Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions

Complete the following steps:

1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json` from the URL `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

  * Use `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

  * Use `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the x values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the y values.

  * Use `sample_values` for the marker size.

  * Use `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

  * Use `otu_labels` for the text values.

> Stucture for coding up to this point is greatly inspired by the Instructor's tutorial for this assignment.


4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

6. Web page updates all the plots when a new sample is selected.

7. Deployed app to GitHub Pages.

## Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional)

The following task is advanced and therefore was optional.

* Adapted the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* Web page updates the chart whenever a new sample is selected.
